# The Great HTML Unscramble

[FIND A FUNNY UNSCRAMBLE GIF]

As you become a great web developer, you will end up writing some *very* complex web pages, perhaps with hundreds of html elements each. The more complicated your web pages get, the more important it will become to keep your code organized and easy to work with. This mini-lab will help you to write better code that will make your life easier and give you a better understanding of the html code you will encounter as a web developer.

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab, and then `cd` into it. 

In the folder, you should find '**unscramble-basic.html**'.

Technically, it's valid HTML, but it's nearly impossible to make sense of--what elements are in what??

Your mission is to organize the HTML by properly indenting it so it's structure its clear to read and every child is indented away from its parent.

***ready for a challenge???***

Open the file "unscramble-challenge.html" and see if you can handle a *real* mess--this file goes a little over the top in showing how much a pain poorly formatted code can be.
You'll see all sorts of unfamiliar elements, but feel free to explore and google new things you haven't seen before!

**Good Luck!**
