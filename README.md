[FIND A FUNNY UNSCRAMBLE GIF]

As you become a great web developer, you will end up writing some *very* complex web pages, perhaps with hundreds of html elements each. The more complicated your web pages get, the more important it will become to keep your code organized and easy to work with. This mini-lab will help you to write better code that will make your life easier and give you a better understanding of the html code you will encounter as a web developer.

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab. There are 2 html files: a basic version, and a challenge version. Your goal is to clean up some very messy code, ensuring the indentation looks correct.

**Good Luck!**
